# Listr - A Nostr Web Client for Making Lists

Listr is a simple and functional web app based on the Nostr Protocol for making lists. With Listr, users can create lists of their favorite websites, Nostr relays, Nostr notes, Nostr articles, or Nostr profiles based on certain categories. Other users can then browse these lists and find new content or users to follow.

## Features

- Create almost any list you want, including lists of your favorite websites, Nostr relays, Nostr notes, Nostr articles, Nostr profiles, or anything else.
- Browse lists created by other users and discover new content or users to follow.
- Create lists with any custom field you want. For example, you can create a list of your favorite movies and add a field for the movie's rating.
- Using categories: you can organize your lists into categories, and then browse all available lists by their categories.
- Create new lists, edit existing lists, and delete lists with a few clicks.
- Simple and easy to use, with a clean and minimalist user interface.
- Implemented NIP-07 (Login with Nostr Signer Extensions) for easy and safe login and event signing. No need to enter your private key or seed phrase.
- Zero metadata manipulation: Listr does not modify any metadata field of your profile. Your bookmarks, contacts, and other data are safe.
- No data collection: Listr does not collect any data from users. All data is stored on the public Nostr relays and is publicly available to anyone.
